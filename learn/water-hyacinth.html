              </font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Trees of this 
              biome include both broadleaf, deciduous trees, such as maple, oak, 
              hickory, and beech, and evergreens, such as hemlock, spruce, and 
              fir. A deciduous forest typically has three to four, and sometimes 
              five, layers of plant growth. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Tall deciduous trees 
              make up the top layer of plant growth, and they create a moderately 
              dense forest canopy. Although the canopy is moderately dense, it 
              does allow sunlight to reach the forest floor. This sunlight allows 
              plants in the other layers to grow. The second layer of plant growth 
              includes saplings and species of trees that are naturally shorter 
              in stature. A third layer (or understory) would include shrubs. 
              Forest herbs, such as wildflowers and berries, make up a fourth 
              layer. During the spring, before the deciduous trees leaf out, these 
              herbs bloom and grow quickly in order to take advantage of the sunlight. 
              A fifth layer would include mosses and lichens that grow on tree 
              trunks. </font></p>

              adaptations</b><br>
              In the spring, deciduous trees begin producing thin, broad, light-weight 
              leaves. This type of leaf structure easily captures the sunlight 
              needed for food production (photosynthesis). The broad leaves are 
              great when temperatures are warm and there is plenty of sunlight. 
              However, when temperatures are cold, the broad leaves expose too 
              much surface area to water loss and tissue damage. To help prevent 
              this damage from occurring, deciduous trees make internal and physical 
              adaptations that are triggered by changes in the climate. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Cooler temperatures and 
              limited sunlight are two climatic conditions that tell the tree 
              to begin adapting. In the Fall, when these conditions occur, the 
              tree cuts off the supply of water to the leaves and seals off the 
              area between the leaf stem and the tree trunk. With limited sunlight 
              and water, the leaf is unable to continue producing chlorophyll, 
              the &quot;green&quot; stuff in the leaves, and as the chlorophyll decreases 
              the leaves change color. The beautiful display of brilliant red, 
              yellow, and gold leaves, associated with deciduous forests in the 
              fall, is a result of this process. Most deciduous trees shed their 
              leaves, once the leaves are brown and dry.</font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="-2" color="#666666">Photos
