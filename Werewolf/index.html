<h2>Werewolf Rules</h2>

<div class="dropdown" style="float:left;">
  <button class="dropbtn">Team Information</button>
  <div class="dropdown-content" style="left:0;">
    <p>Good (Villagers) - The good team is all the villagers, and anyone on their side. Every day, the villagers vote one or zero people to have hung. Examples are the sheriff, bodyguard, or medic.</p>
	<p>Bad (Werewolves) - The bad team is all the werewolves, and any of their variants. Every night, the werewolves vote on one person to be killed. All bad roles are told of their teammates, but aren't told exactly what their teammates' roles are.</p>
	<p>Nonaligned - Any roles that aren't werewolves, but aren't very good either. Examples are the serial killer and the jester.
